<p>KRis core module, containing the domain logic on how to interpret RIS records and RIS files.</p>
<p>This module can be used in case you already have the flows or collections of Strings and handle
reading from or writing to files yourself.</p>
<p>Relate to the module <code>kris-io</code> to find add-on functionality that takes care of the IO tasks
like writing to file or reading to file.</p>
<p>This module contains code samples sourced by the guide.
The compiler ensures the code is not outdated.</p>
<p>KRis extra module that builds on top of <code>kris-core</code> and offers additional functionality
to read from files or write to files in various ways. If your application manages that
autonomously, you don't need the IO module, e.g. in the context of a web application that
does not have access to the file system directly and needs to interact with the Browser
for uploading/downloading content to the user's machine.</p>
